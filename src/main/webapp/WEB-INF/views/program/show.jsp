<h1 class="textCenter">Camp Counsellor</h1>
<h2>What is a typical day like for a Camp Counsellor?</h2>
<p>Although every camp is different, most camps have similarities in how they run on a daily basis.
    So use this as a guide to help you imagine what to expect from a day on camp!</p>

<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>Each day there are going to be lots of activities going on all over camp. Activity sessions will normally run for an hour and campers will move from one to the next.
    If you're hired by a camp to teach a particular activity, you will normally stay in your area to teach that activity to different groups throughout the day.
    General Counsellors will move around with the campers and help them get involved in each activity. So from the Waterfront, Sports Pitches, Theatre,
    Pool, Stables, there's always something happening anywhere you look!</p>

<h3>Meals</h3>
<p>Meal times are a lot of fun at camp as well as being pretty hectic. Counsellors will sit at the tables with the campers and will be responsible for collecting/serving the food.
    Don't be surprised for spontaneous songs, chants and games to break out in the dining hall! It's also a time when announcements or special mentions will get made, while the whole camp is in one place.
    There are 3 meals served each day on camp and the great thing is - you don't have to cook them!</p>

<h3>Time Off</h3>
<p>Depending on how your camp schedule works, you're likely to get some time off during the day. This may be a specific activity block or just a set time period throughout the day.
    You'll often work on a rotational system so there's always some Counsellors with the campers. On your time off you can often get involved in some of the activities on offer or just have a lie down and try catch up on some rest!</p>

<h3>Evening Activity</h3>
<p>After dinner there will be an evening activity that will involve the whole camp or large groups of the campers together i.e. boys and girls.
    This will be a slightly different activity that isn't on the regular schedule and will give you the chance to get involved in something different and be with the other campers and Counsellors that you haven't been working with throughout the day.
    Evening activity can include things like; camp fires, dances, all-camp swim, pool parties, treasure hunts, theatre performances plus any creative ideas that the staff have to keep the camp entertained!</p><br>

<h1 class="textCenter">Camp Support</h1>
<h2>What is a typical day like for a Camp Support Staff?</h2>
<p>As you're not directly responsibile for the campers or for teaching activities, you'll often find that your day includes more time off!</p>

<h3>Your Schedule</h3>
<p>As you're not in charge of the campers, you won't be on duty around the clock like the Counsellors. You'll typically work in a more shift/rotational routine so you'll have different periods of time off throughout the day and almost all evenings off. You'll also get days over the summer where you'll be able to get off camp and explore the local towns and cities close by to camp.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>Camp Support staff have their own accomodation seperate to the campers and Counsellors. Obviously when you're on duty you need to stay in you're work area but when you've got time off you'll be encouraged to join in with the camp activities. You'll also share evenings and days off with some of the Counsellors, so you'll have plenty of time to hang-out with them too!</p>
